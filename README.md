# cl-jack - Common Lisp interface to (lib)jack #

This library provides ffi-bindings and various Common Lisp based
functionality to connect to the [jack](https://jackaudio.org//) api
from Lisp.

Originally programmed as part of the Linux port of OpenMusic in 2013.
Later extracted into a self-contained package.

The files [test-jack-audio.lisp](file:test-jack-audio.lisp) and
[test-jack-midi.lisp](file:test-jack-midi.lisp) contain some testing
code.

This code is tested in LispWorks versions 6 and 7.
